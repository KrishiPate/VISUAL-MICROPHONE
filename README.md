# VISUAL-MICROPHONE
Tried to build a Model using python and MATLAB to regenerate a sound signal by analyzing the vibration it creates
on the surface of an object nearby.

A sound signal was generated inside a soundproof room and an object (eg. Bag of chips) was filmed using a
HD Camera placed outside the room.

The Video was then processed by using pyrtools and OpenCV to regenerate the original audio signal.
